Embedding LM/D into Gopher as a Veronica-like service

The LM/D (lutmake/deref) package can be embedded into gopher servers to
provide a veronica-style service, e.g. as a menu server for just one campus.

The system consists of several modules, some are used to prepare data for
the server, others are called when someone initiates a search request.

Major steps (overwiew):

    Phase               Step            Description
a.  preparation         GOPHSCAN        scan complete servers for menus

                        LUTMAKE         generate lookup-tables and index
                                        files from scanned gopher menus

b.  service             DEREF           return all items that match
                                        a user's query


Notes:
+  GOPHSCAN is a REXX program that comes with the VieGOPHER package.
+  LUTMAKE, DEREF are part of a different package.  They are written in
   C and can be compiled for VM/CMS, various Unixes and MSDOS.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GOPHSCAN

Gophscan is distributed with the VieGOPHER package.  This program scans
through one or a group of gopher servers and produces one file named
GOPHSCAN.OUT.  This file is essentially one large gopher menu.  Servers
should be scanned from time to time or when major changes occur.

Several files produced by GOPHSCAN can be combined into one larger
overall gopher menu just by concatinating them.

The current version of GOPHSCAN runs only under VM/CMS, a version for
Unix will follow.

Usage (#######)
GOPHSCAN  <server>[:<port>]     (1 or more)

Each parameter for GOPHSCAN is the name and port of a gopher server.
If the port number is ommited, the standard port number 70 is assumed.
Gophscan will walk through all the menus of the named gopher servers.
It will not leave the area of the named servers.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LUTMAKE

LUTMAKE's role is to process one single (large) gopher menu produced
in the Gophscan-step to generate lookup tables and other index files
for the DEREF-phase.

Usage
LUTMAKE -mv gophscan.out

The flag -mv advises LUTMAKE to work in Veronica-mode, it will read
the input file and produces three files:
xxx.lut         (lookup table) contains lexical information about
                the words from gophscan.out and associates them with
                an index into the xxx.wi file.
xxx.wi          (word information) contains references for any indexed
                word into the xxx.di structure
xxx.di          (document information) contains identification codes
                for any document indexed.

In veronica mode, the document ID is the offset value of the beginning
of each line in the large gopher menu gophscan.out.  Therefore, it's
not possible to index more than one file in veronica-mode at once.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEREF

When a user formulates a search request, the program DEREF is called
to lookup the word in the lookup table (xxx.lut).  With the word
information (xxx.wi) records pointing into the document identification
table, (xxx.di) the program will locate each line containing the
searched words in the large gopher menu file (gophscan.out)

Usage:
DEREF -mvgophscan.out  word
