How to build:

  make

If you want to build the Perl module and have SWIG on your machine, you
may want to try this:

  perl Makefile-swig.pl >>Makefile
  make tfb.so

To test if the module was built correctly, try this:

  perl -e 'use tfb;'

This should not return anything (at least nothing that looks like an error).
