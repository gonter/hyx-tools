[To be completed]

This repository contains source code mostly created for a collection
of hypertext tools.  Since this "project" was started around 1986,
HTML or even the WWW was not part of the picture.  In fact, not
even SGML was widely known at that time and Charles F. Goldfarb's
book[1] only arrived in 1990.  So, the format used might look like
SGML and even be referenced as "SGML", but it isn't.  However, SGML
compliance, or nowadays XML compliance, is still a goal.

Some parts of this repository are totally unrelated to anything,
they are only here because I didn't care to remove them before
moving everything to SourceForge.

How to use the software

First, only a few people are expected to use the entire repository.
Most users will use subsets of code with a more reasonable structure
and setup routines.

This repository consists of currently two major parts:
/lib/  ... the library
/app/  ... the applications

There are Perl scripts called "SetupWork" in several places.  Their
output are shell commands to create various symbolic links which
are necessary for the compiler to find include files, etc.  I hope
to improve the setup some time in the future.

Some modules require Tcl or even Tk (the last tested version was
Tcl/Tk 8.4 but Tcl/Tk 8.0 might work too).  Unfortunately, path
names for Tcl/Tk are hardcoded in most places.  Again, I hope to
improve that in the future.  ...ooO( I really need to read [2] )...

A typical start might look like that:

  cd lib
  perl SetupWork >@work
  $EDITOR @work    # inspect the shell script, it
                   # should only create symbolic links
  sh -v @work
  make
  cd ..

If you want to compile Tcl stuff too, verfy the path to your Tcl
stuff and:

  cd lib/ds
  make all.using-tcl
  cd ../..

After that, to compile the applications:

  cd app
  perl SetupWork >@work
  $EDITOR @work    # inspect the shell script, it
                   # should only create symbolic links
  sh -v @work
  make
  cd ..

NED

NED is a text editor which dates back to 1986 and was first used on a
CP/M-68K machine.  The editor was then ported to MS-DOS 3.3 or so,
evolved into a Hypertext thingy.  Later it was ported over to Unix
(AIX, HP-UX, FreeBSD.  Linux might also work, but I'm not sure if I
ever tested it there).  Thus this module is more or less the core
element of the whole repository.

If you also want to compile NED (or n00), proceed as follows.  This
currently *requires* Tcl even for the curses mode version and for the
X11 version Tk is required!  Tcl/Tk 8.4 should work.

  cd app/ned
  perl SetupWork >@work
  $EDITOR @work    # inspect the shell script, it
                   # should only create symbolic links
  sh -v @work
  make all.groups all
  cd ../..

Questions that may arise:
1. Q: what are those *.ftr files in the _bak_ftr.ned directory?
   A: these files contain "feature" information about their parent
      file, such as hypertext links.  After all, creating hypertext
      was the reason for creating the project in the first place!
      Embedding the links within the source file requires extra
      processing for compilation and distribution, so keeping this
      information in another file makes development simpler.
2. Q: I sent you a patch/bug report/etc.  Why don't you answer?
   A: Sorry, I'm quite busy and sometimes too lazy to hack around,
      so I usually have a huge backlog of work to do, so it may
      take me quite a while to reply.  I hope that using SourceForge
      (please use the tracker, when possible) will reduce turnaround
      time.
